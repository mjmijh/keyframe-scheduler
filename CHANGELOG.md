## Blueprint: keyframe_smart_light_follower

### [1.0] - 2026-03-13

Initial versioned release. Corresponds to the blueprint formerly known as "v4.0" in the blueprint name.

Features:
- Applies Keyframe Scheduler sensor outputs to a target light via `light.turn_on`
- Context-aware manual override detection (true user actions vs. PICO internal updates)
- Ignores PICO Smart Restore context (`picolightnode` in context ID)
- Smooth sync on Follow External enable (3s transition)
- Handles missing/unavailable sensors gracefully
- Auto-scaled DIM input (0..100 or 0..1)
- Reads `transition_seconds` from Keyframe Scheduler sensor attributes
- Triggered every 60s and on sensor state change

Requires: Keyframe Scheduler Component v2.6.0+, PICOlightnode v2.0.18+ (for context tracking)
